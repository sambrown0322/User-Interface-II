    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Denver, Colorado, and as a result, I'm a huge Denver Broncos
      fan. We moved to San Diego when I was three years old, and I lived there
      for the next 15 years! I attended Poway High School where I was on the
      wrestling team, was a member of the Die Lieders choral ensemble, and was a
      member of our Peer Counseling group.
